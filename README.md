"# SQL-project" 

<<<<<<< HEAD
This was done as an assignment in the Bottega Full Stack Development course. 
It was my first real experience in tackling problems without following a tutorial. 
=======
Project contains the following technical features:
    Build a database with the following tables: Students, Courses, Professors, Grades
    Foreign key relationships between the tables
    Create a script that populates all of the database tables with sample data
    SQL query scripts for:
        The average grade that is given by each professor
        The top grades for each student
        Sort students by the courses that they are enrolled in
        Create a summary report of courses and their average grades, sorted by the most challenging course (course with the lowest average grade) to the easiest course
        Finding which student and professor have the most courses in common
